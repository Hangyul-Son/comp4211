HKUST Introduction to Machine Learning

## Programming Assignment 1

The objectives of this programming assignment are:
- To practise some data importing and preprocessing skills by using the pandas library

- To gain a better understanding of supervised learning methods by using scikit-learn.

- To evaluate the performance of several supervised learning methods by conducting empir- ical study on a real-world dataset.

## Programming Assignment 2

The objective of this programming assignment are:
- To practise using the TensorFlow machine learning framework through implementing custom training modules and data reader modules for image generation on the Chinese Calligraphy dataset using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture. 

- Develop the CNN-based model step by step and study how to build custom modules on TensorFlow and the effects of different model configurations.

## Final Project

The objective of the final project are:
- To understand the role in machine learning in the field of anomaly detection. 

- Design a code example to demonstrate the understanding of Isolation Forest anomaly detection mechanism in a real world stock price dataset.
